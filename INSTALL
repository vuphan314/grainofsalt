To compile, you will need:
* cmake
* bignum library (with development headers)
* boost library (with development headers)
* zlib library (with development headers)

Once these are installed, issue:

$ cd build
$ cmake ../
$ make

Please do NOT try to skip the "cd build". Your build will succeed, but
it will not be useable.

To use, issue from directory 'build':

$ ./grainofsalt --num 100 --outputs 90 --crypto grain
